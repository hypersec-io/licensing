# Commercial Licensing

This software is licensed under the Functional Source License, Version 1.1,
ALv2 Future License (FSL-1.1-ALv2). See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for terms.

## When You Need a Commercial License

A commercial license from HyperI is required if you want to:

- **Offer as a Service**: Provide the software as a hosted SaaS, PaaS, or
  managed service to third parties
- **Embed or Bundle**: Include the software in your own commercial product
  for distribution or sale
- **Resell or White-Label**: Redistribute the software under your own brand
  or as part of a resale arrangement
- **Intra-Group Service Provider**: Operate the software on behalf of other
  entities in your corporate group (see below)

## When You Don't Need a Commercial License

The FSL allows you to use this software without a commercial license for:

- **Internal Use**: Using the software within your own organisation for
  your own purposes
- **Self-Hosting**: Running the software on your own infrastructure for
  your own use
- **Non-Commercial Education**: Teaching, learning, and academic research
- **Non-Commercial Research**: Research that is not intended for commercial
  advantage
- **Professional Services**: Helping licensees deploy and use the software
  in accordance with the FSL terms

## Corporate Groups and Affiliates

**"Internal use" means use within a single legal entity.**

### Multiple Entities Using Independently

If multiple entities in your corporate group each deploy and operate their
own instance of the software for their own internal purposes, each entity
may do so under the FSL without a commercial license.

Example: Parent Co, Subsidiary A, and Subsidiary B each run their own
separate deployment for their own use. This is permitted under the FSL.

### One Entity Providing Services to Others

If one entity in your corporate group operates the software and provides
access or services to other entities in the group, this is **not** internal
use - it is providing a service. This requires a commercial license with
intra-group hosting rights.

Example: Shared Services Co runs a centralised deployment and provides
access to Parent Co, Subsidiary A, and Subsidiary B. This requires a
commercial license.

**Why?** The distinction is based on who operates the software versus who
benefits from it. When Entity A operates software for the benefit of
Entity B, that is providing a service - regardless of corporate relationship.
This is the same activity that hyperscalers perform, just within a corporate
group rather than publicly.
